Introduction
------------

Our application focuses on solving the problem of climate change by utilizing the real-world data that is currently available. The Application searches data like air-quality, forest density and ground water level in the user area and uses all the data to calculate a normalized score for each user and recommend them tasks based on their normalized score. Users can also maintain, track, share, and collaborate with other users.

The application fetches the address of the user through reverse geocoding API from the location coordinates obtained from the app. Using the location we fetch the following data - 

1. [Air quality data of user location through whether it API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/airquality-current)

2. [Forest cover and trees cover data of user's district from Data.gov.in using API](https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-tree-cover-estimates-india-state-forest-report-isfr-during-2015from-ministry/api#/Resource/get_resource_4b573150_4b0e_4a38_9f4b_ae643de88f09)

3. [Users district groundwater level data from Data.gov.in using API](https://data.gov.in/resources/district-wise-dynamic-ground-water-resources-july-2017-0)
